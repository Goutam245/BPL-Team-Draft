Use key features of this project
Dynamic Player Selection with Validation Description: Allows users to select players from a list of available options. Users can see detailed player information such as name, country, role, type, and bidding price. Key Functionalities: Validation ensures: Users cannot select a player if they lack sufficient coins. Duplicate player selection is prevented. Limits player selection to a maximum of 6 players.

Description: Implements a simple virtual economy where users earn coins by interacting with the app and spend them to "buy" players. Key Functionalities: Coins increase when the user clicks the "Earn Coins" button in the banner. Players can only be purchased if the user has enough coins, ensuring strategic decision-making.

Toggle Between Available and Selected Players Description: A toggle system allows users to seamlessly switch between viewing the available players and their selected team. Key Functionalities: The Available view shows all players that can still be selected. The Selected view displays the user's chosen players with details and allows them to remove players if desired.
